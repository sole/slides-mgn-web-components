Also see the counterpart repo where I informally experimented with [interoperability between web components and frameworks](https://github.com/sole/wc-interop).

And this [Web Components content kit](https://github.com/mozdevs/ck-web-components) with a bit more of a script and longer form of these slides (sort of).

First, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
2. [Bower](http://bower.io): `$ npm install -g bower`
3. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com): `$ npm install -g gulp`

Then, install dependencies and run the preview server:

```bash
$ npm install && bower install
$ gulp serve
```
